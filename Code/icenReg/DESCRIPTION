Description: Regression models for interval censored data. Currently supports
    Cox-PH, proportional odds, and accelerated failure time models. Allows for
    both semi and fully parametric models (parametric only for accelerated failure
    time models). Includes functions for easy visual diagnostics of model fits and
    imputation of censored data.
