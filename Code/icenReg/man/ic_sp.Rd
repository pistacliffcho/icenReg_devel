\description{
 	Fits a semi-parametric model for interval censored data. Can fit either a Cox-PH model or a proportional odds model.  
 	
 	The covariance matrix for the regression coefficients is estimated via bootstrapping. For large datasets, this can become slow so parallel processing can be used to take advantage of multiple cores via the \code{foreach} package. 
  
 }
 
\details{

	Response variable should either be of the form \code{cbind(l, u)} or \code{Surv(l, u, type = 'interval2')}, where \code{l} and \code{u} are the lower and upper ends of the interval known to contain the event of interest. Uncensored data can be included by setting \code{l == u}, right censored data can be included by setting \code{u == Inf} or \code{u == NA} and left censored data can be included by setting \code{l == 0}.
	
	The argument \code{B} determines whether the intervals should be open or closed, i.e. \code{B = c(0,1)} implies that the event occurs within the interval \code{(l,u]}. The exception is that if \code{l == u}, it is assumed that the event is uncensored, regardless of \code{B}. 
	
	In regards to weights, they are not standardized. This means that if weight[i] = 2, this is the equivalent to having two observations with the same values as subject i. 

  The algorithm used is inspired by the extended ICM algorithm from Wei Pan 1999. However, it uses a conditional Newton Raphson step (for the regression parameters) and an ICM step (for the baseline survival parameters), rather than one single ICM step (for both sets). In addition, a gradient ascent can also be used to update the baseline parameters. This step is necessary if the data contains many uncensored observations, very similar to how the EM algorithm greatly accelerates the ICM algorithm for the NPMLE (gradient ascent is used rather than the EM, as the M step is not in closed form for semi-parametric models). 
  
  Earlier versions of icenReg used an active set algorithm, which was not as fast for large datasets.
