\title{Non-Parametric Estimator for Interval Censored Data}
\usage{
ic_np(formula = NULL, data, maxIter = 1000, tol = 10^-10, B = c(0, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula for stratification. If only one group, can be left blank and 
data must be entered as n x 2 matrix.}

\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or an n x 2 matrix. See details.}

\item{maxIter}{Maximum iterations}

\item{tol}{Numeric tolerance}

\item{B}{Should intervals be open or closed? See details.

 @description
 Fits the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) for univariate interval censored data. 
 This is a generalization of the Kaplan-Meier curves that allows for interval censoring. 
 Also referred to as the Turnbull estimator.}

Non-Parametric Estimator for Interval Censored Data

\details{
\code{data} must be an n x 2 matrix or data.frame containing two columns of data representing 
left and right sides of the censoring interval, denoted L and R. This allows for left censored 
(L == 0), right censored (R == inf), uncensored (L == R) along with general interval censored observations. 

The argument \code{B} determines whether the intervals should be open or closed, i.e. 
\code{B = c(0,1)} implies that the event occurs within the interval \code{(l,u]}. 
The exception is that if \code{l == u}, it is assumed that the event is uncensored, regardless of \code{B}.

The NPMLE is fit using an efficient implementation of the EMICM algorithm.
