\usage{
  makeCtrls_icsp(useGA = T, maxIter = 10000, baseUpdates = 5,
                 regStart = NULL)
}
\arguments{

  \item{useGA}{Should constrained gradient ascent step be used?}
  \item{maxIter}{Maximum iterations}
  \item{baseUpdates}{number of baseline updates (ICM + GA) per iteration}
  \item{regStart}{Initial values for regression parameters}
}
\description{
  Creates the control options for the \code{ic_sp} function. Defaults not intended to be changed for use in standard analyses.    
}

\details{
  The constrained gradient step, actived by \code{useGA = T}, is a step that was added to improve the convergence in a special case. The option to turn it off is only in place to help demonstrate it's utility. 
  
  \code{regStart} also for seeding of initial value of regression parameters. Intended for use in ``warm start" for bootstrap samples and providing fixed regression parameters when calculating fit in qq-plots.
