\title{Lung Tumor Interval Censored Data from Hoel and Walburg 1972}
\description{
RFM mice were sacrificed and examined for lung tumors. This resulted in current status interval censored data: 
if the tumor was present, this implied left censoring and if no tumor was present this implied right censoring. 
Mice were placed in two different groups: conventional environment or germ free environment.
}
\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{l}}{left side of observation interval}

\item{\code{u}}{right side of observation interval}

\item{\code{grp}}{Group for mouse. Either ce (conventional environment) or ge (grem-free environment)}
}}

#In practice, more bootstrap samples should be used for inference
#Keeping it quick for CRAN testing purposes
